\maketitle
{\noindent\bf\color{red} Instructions:}
\begin{itemize}
\item {\color{blue} Your Name: \underline{\hspace{20em}}   ID Number: \underline{\hspace{10em}}}
\item You may have one piece of paper on which you put notes, plus scratch paper.
\item You may use a calculator, though it will likely be of no use, since there is a table of reduced row echelon forms at the end of the exam.
\item In every question, assume that you are working over the real numbers (no complex numbers, no numbers modulo $p$).
\item Be careful.  If you can think of any possible way to double check your work do so.  Try to get a perfect score!
\item All questions are true or false and worth 4 points (for a total of 100).
\end{itemize}
