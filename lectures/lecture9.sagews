# <span style="color:darkblue;">Lecture 9: Subspaces, Basis, Dimension, and Rank (part 2)</span>

(reminder: Google+ Hangout)

## <span style="color:darkred;">Reminder: The first midterm is WEDNESDAY (April 24)!</span>

1. Read/review the following sections from the book over the weekend.  Do as many of the problems from the book as you possibly can (when I was a student I would just do them *all* -- once you get going it gets fast).

    * 2.3 -- spanning sets and linear independence
    * 3.1 -- matrix operations
    * 3.2 -- matrix algebra
    * 3.3 -- the inverse of a matrix
    * 3.5 -- subspaces, basis, dimension, and rank<br><br>

2. You can bring one piece of paper you put notes on (and a calculator, if you want) to the exam.

3. I will give a review lecture on Monday, April 22.

After the exam, we will start "eigenvectors" (chapter 4), yet another really surprising idea that reveals an enormous amount of secret *hidden structure* in a matrix.

# New Definition: Subspace

A **subspace** of $\mathbb{R}^n$ is a nonempty set $S$ of vectors in
$\mathbb{R}^n$ such that if $u,v \in S$ and $a,b\in\mathbb{R}$, then $au+bv \in S$.


## Subspaces and Spans

In other words, a subspace is a subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$ such that if you take any vectors in $S$, then the span of these vectors is also in $S$.


---

**Theorem**: *The subspaces $S$ of $\mathbb{R}^n$ are **exactly** the spans ${\rm span}(v\_1, \ldots, v\_m)$ for some vectors $v\_i$.*

---

Let's prove the easy half, namely that every span is a subspace.  (This is easy: just check the axiom.)

### Definition: A Basis for a Subspace $S$

A **basis** for a subspace $S$ is a list of linearly independent vector $v\_1, \ldots, v\_m$ that span $S$.


### Remarks and Examples
1. What is a basis for $\mathbb{R}^n$?

2. What is a basis for the span $S$ of $(1,2,3)$, $(4,5,6)$, $(7,8,9)$?

3. **Fact:** Any nonzero subspace $S$ has infinitely many different bases.  WHY?

4. It's called a "basis" since every element of $S$ can be written uniquely in terms of if.

### The Canonical Basis for a Subspace $S$

There are many different choices of $v\_1,\ldots, v\_m$ that span $S$, but there is one that is **canonical**:

 - For any choice at all of $v\_1, \ldots, v\_m$, form the matrix $A$ with *rows* $v\_1,\ldots, v\_m$.

 - Let $B$ be the matrix obtained from the reduced row echelon form ${\rm rref}(A)$ but with all zero rows deleted.

 - The matrix $B$ does not depend on the choice of $v\_i$.   It is a canonical choice of basis for $S$.  (This is the matrix that Sage uses when printing a subspace above.)


We will call the above basis *the* **reduced row echelon form basis** for $S$.

### Dimension

**Definition:** The *dimension* of a Subspace is the number of vectors in the reduced row echelon form basis.

**Theorem:** *The number of vectors in any basis for $S$ is the same.*

Proof: If the rows of a basis are linearly independent and you put the matrix in reduced row echelon form, then no zero rows appear.  (Maybe prove carefully in class by considering columns and systems of equations.)
