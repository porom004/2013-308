# Lecture 7: Linear Independence

---

## New Topic: Vectors, Matrics, and Linear Independence

**WHY?** This is preparation for "vector spaces" -- you should read Section 3.5 of the book before Wednesday, since this is important and hard.


**Definitions:**

- When I say **vector** I mean an $n\times 1$ matrix.  You can think of a vector as an arrow from the origin to the point in space with those $n$ coordinates.

- We will denote the set of all of vectors with $n$ real number entries by $\mathbb{R}^n$. Similarly, if the entries are complex numbers, we write $\mathbb{C}^n$, if rational numbers, we write $\mathbb{Q}^n$, and if the entries are numbers modulo a prime $p$, we write $\mathbb{F}_{p}^n$.

- If $A$ is an $n\times m$ matrix and $v\in \mathbb{R}^m$, then $Av$ is a matrix with $n$ rows (and $1$ column), so $Av \in \mathbb{R}^n$.  Thus $A$ defines a *function* $\mathbb{R}^m \to \mathbb{R}^n$.  This function is called a *linear transformation*, and has many nice properties, as we will soon see.



Since it is hard to type in an $n\times 1$ matrix, I'll often write "Consider the vector $v=(1,2,3)$", but I mean $v$ to be the $3 \times 1$ matrix with entries $1,2,3$.  OK?

<h3>Linear Independence: this is a new idea that will be very useful in understanding everything that follows in this course!</h3>

<b>Definition:</b> We say that the set of vectors $\{v_1,\ldots v_k\}$ are <b>linearly independent</b> if there is no way to find scalars $c_1, \ldots, c_k$ that are not all zero such that $c_1 v_1 + c_2 v_2 + \cdots+ c_k v_k=0$.
<br><br>

Huh??
<br>
Thus:<br><br>
<ul>
<li> $v_1,\ldots, v_k$ are linearly independent if when you form the matrix $A$ with columns the $v_i$, then the equation $Ax = 0$ has a unique solution (namely, $x=0$).</li>
<br>
<li>  (heuristically) $v_1,\ldots, v_k$ are linearly independent if---when viewed as vectors---they all point in genuinely different directions.
</li>
</ul>

<br><br>
Let's try this out...
